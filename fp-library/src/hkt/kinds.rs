//! Traits representing type-level application to simulate higher-kinded types.
//!
//! The naming convention used by these traits is `KindNLMT` where `N`
//! represents the number of lifetimes and `M` represents the number of
//! generic types.
//!
//! As an example of how to use these traits, the trait [`Kind0L1T`] would be
//! implemented by a [`Brand`][crate::brands] representing type constructors
//! with 0 lifetimes and 1 generic type. A type `Foo<A>` would have a
//! higher-kinded representation `FooBrand` which implements [`Kind0L1T`].
