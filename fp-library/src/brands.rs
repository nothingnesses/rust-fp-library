//! Higher-kinded representations of [types][crate::types].
//!
//! Brands represent higher-kinded (unapplied/partially-applied) forms of
//! [types][crate::types], as opposed to concrete types, which are
//! fully-applied.
//!
//! For example, [`VecBrand`] represents the higher-kinded type `Vec`, whereas
//! `Vec A`/`Vec<A>` is the concrete type where `Vec` has been applied to some
//! generic type `A`.
