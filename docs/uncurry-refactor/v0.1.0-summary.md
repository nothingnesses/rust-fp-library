# v0.1.0 Release Summary

## Overview

This release marks a significant milestone for `fp-library`, transitioning from the experimental v1 API to the zero-cost, uncurried v2 API. The legacy v1 API has been completely removed, and the v2 API has been promoted to the crate root.

## Key Changes

### 1. Removal of Legacy v1 API
- The curried API (formerly under `classes`, `types`, `functions`) has been removed.
- Feature flags `v1` and `v2` have been removed. The library now provides a single, unified API.

### 2. Promotion of v2 API
- The uncurried API (formerly under `v2`) has been moved to the crate root.
- Modules `classes`, `types`, and `functions` now contain the new API.
- `brands` module remains as the central registry for higher-kinded type brands.

### 3. Refactoring and Cleanup
- Internal imports have been updated to reflect the new structure.
- `clippy::multiple_bound_locations` warnings have been resolved in core traits and implementations.
- Documentation has been updated to remove migration notes and references to the old API.

## Migration Guide

Users upgrading from `0.0.x` to `0.1.0` must update their code to use the uncurried API.

### Imports

- Replace `fp_library::v2::...` with `fp_library::...`.
- Replace `fp_library::classes::...` (v1) with `fp_library::classes::...` (v2).

### Function Calls

- Functions like `map`, `bind`, `traverse` are now uncurried.
- Example: `map(f)(x)` becomes `map(f, x)`.

### Type Classes

- Trait definitions have been simplified and optimized for zero-cost abstractions.
- `CloneableFn` is still used where necessary for type erasure, but many operations now work with bare closures.

## Verification

- `cargo test` passes (133 tests).
- `cargo clippy` passes (0 warnings).
- `cargo doc` builds successfully.
