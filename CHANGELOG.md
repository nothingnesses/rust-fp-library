## [0.1.0] - 2026-01-12

### Added

- **Zero-Cost Abstractions**: The library has been completely refactored to use uncurried, monomorphized type classes. This eliminates the overhead of intermediate closures and dynamic dispatch for most operations.
- **`Lift` Trait**: A new trait for lifting binary functions into a context (`lift2`). This enables zero-cost combination of contexts without creating intermediate closures.
- **`Kind1L1T`**: Upgraded HKT infrastructure to support types with lifetimes (like `Lazy`).
- **`VecBrand::construct` / `deconstruct`**: Re-introduced uncurried versions of these helper methods.
- **Tests**: Added property-based tests for `Pair`, `Endomorphism`, `Endofunction` and unit tests for `OnceCell`, `OnceLock`.

### Changed

- **Uncurried API**: All type class methods (`map`, `bind`, `apply`, `fold_right`, etc.) are now uncurried.
    - `map(f)(fa)` -> `map(f, fa)`
    - `bind(ma)(f)` -> `bind(ma, f)`
- **Generic Bounds**: Trait methods now use generic `F: Fn(A) -> B` bounds instead of `ClonableFn` where possible, enabling inlining and monomorphization.
- **`Lazy`**: Now implements `Semigroup`, `Monoid`, and `Defer`. It does *not* implement `Functor` or `Monad` due to `Clone` requirements for memoization.
- **`Endofunction` / `Endomorphism`**: Updated to work with the new uncurried `Semigroup` trait while preserving type erasure for composition.

### Removed

- **Legacy v1 API**: The entire curried API (formerly under `classes`, `types`, `functions`) has been removed.
- **Feature Flags**: `v1` and `v2` feature flags have been removed. The library now provides a single, unified API.
- **`construct` / `deconstruct` (Curried)**: The curried versions were removed in favor of the uncurried ones.

### Fixed

- **`clippy::multiple_bound_locations`**: Resolved warnings in core traits.
- **Internal Imports**: Fixed all internal imports to reflect the new module structure.
- **Brand Types**: Brand types (e.g., `OptionBrand`, `VecBrand`) have been moved to `crate::brands` and are no longer re-exported from `crate::types`. Users should import them from `fp_library::brands`.
